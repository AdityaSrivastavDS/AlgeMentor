    "question": "What is the limit of (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1?",
    "answer": "To find the limit of (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1, we can first try to directly substitute x = 1 into the expression.\n(1^2 - 1) / (1 - 1) = (1 - 1) / (0) = 0 / 0\nSince we have an indeterminate form of 0/0, we can try to simplify the expression.\nWe can factor the numerator as a difference of squares:\nx^2 - 1 = (x - 1)(x + 1)\nSo, the expression becomes:\n(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) = ((x - 1)(x + 1)) / (x - 1)\nAs long as x is not equal to 1, we can cancel the (x - 1) terms:\n(x^2 - 1) / (x - 1) = x + 1\nNow, we can find the limit as x approaches 1:\nlim (x\u21921) (x + 1)\nSubstitute x = 1 into the expression:\n1 + 1 = 2\nSo, the limit of (x^2 - 1)/(x - 1) as x approaches 1 is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
